I'm Taylor, a data scientist based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
This is my personal website, which I started to share my personal projects, self-learnings, code (mostly R and Python), and thoughts on various topics in data science.

I work at Yelp as a Data Science Analyst where, among other things, I design and analyze  online experiments.
Before that, I worked for Ardea Outcomes, a contract research organization supporting pharmaceutical companies in clinical trials.
My background is in Physics. I earned my MSc from Dalhousie University, and my BSc from the University of Prince Edward Island.
